<p>
Workwise, I'm a professor in the 
<a href="http://www.comp.mq.edu.au">School of Computing</a>
of
<a href="http://www.mq.edu.au">Macquarie University</a>,
in 
<a href="http://www.sydneyguide.net.au/">Sydney</a>,
Australia.
(Here's my <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/mark-dras">official university page</a>.)
Before Macquarie, I was a research fellow at the 
<a href="http://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a>'s
Institute for
Research in Cognitive Science.

<p>
<a href="pics/chatgpt_thumbnail_dras.png">Here</a> is how <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>
described me on 10 Feb 2023 based on a colleague's prompt.  It contains some of the sorts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)">hallucinations</a>
that neural language models are prone to (see also <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.387.pdf">discussions of possible reasons for these</a>, and a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03629">survey of research on the issue</a>); I'll leave it open as to what ChatGPT has hallucinated about me.

<h4>RESEARCH</H4>

<p>
I work
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural
language processing (NLP)</a> / language technology / computational
linguistics, and am a member of
the Machine Learning and
Natural Language Processing research group</a>.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, I've worked on (among other things)
privacy and NLP,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native-language_identification">native
  language identification</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">machine
translation</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation">natural
language generation</a>, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment
analysis</a> (with a focus on how sentiment affects language choices).

<h4>TEACHING</h4>

<p>
  In semester 1, 2024, I'll be teaching

  <ul>
    <li>
      COMP2010 Algorithms and Data Structures
      [<a href="https://coursehandbook.mq.edu.au/2024/units/COMP2010/">Handbook</a>
      | <a href="https://unitguides.mq.edu.au/unit_offerings/162998/unit_guide">Unit Guide</a>]
</li>


  </ul>

  
</p>

<p>
In semester 2, 2024, I'll be on sabbatical.

</p>



<p>
I've taught a <a
href="teaching/teaching.html#past_teaching">range of units</a>
    over the years.
I also think it's useful for students to know something about what their
teachers are likely to be like.  As one source of information, there's
the sporadic appearance of the Alternative Calendar, but computing
units are hardly ever mentioned there, and it usually sounds as if
there's only ever a couple of (disgruntled) respondants.

So, in case you're thinking of taking a class with me, here's a link
to 
<a 
href="teaching/teaching.html#past_teaching_evals">evaluations for
several of my units</a>.
</p>



<h4>OTHER</h4>

<p>
Some <a href="other.html">non-work things</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm a member of
Macquarie's <a href="https://staff.mq.edu.au/work/diversity-and-community/programs-and-initiatives/ally-network">Ally Network</a>.
