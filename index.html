This photo is from 2014, visiting
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg_Castle">castle in
Heidelberg</a> while on sabbatical at the University of T&uuml;bingen.
I'm pondering either the legacy of Count Carl von Graimberg, or the
hot chocolate to come shortly.

<p>
Workwise, I'm a professor in the 
<a href="http://www.comp.mq.edu.au">School of Computing</a>
of
<a href="http://www.mq.edu.au">Macquarie University</a>,
in 
<a href="http://www.sydneyguide.net.au/">Sydney</a>,
Australia.
Before Macquarie, I was a research fellow at the 
<a href="http://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a>'s
Institute for
Research in Cognitive Science.

<h4>RESEARCH</H4>

<p>
I work
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural
language processing (NLP)</a> / language technology / computational
linguistics, and am a member of
the Machine Learning and
Natural Language Processing research group</a>.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, I've worked on (among other things)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native-language_identification">native
  language identification</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">machine
translation</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation">natural
language generation</a>, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">sentiment
analysis</a> (with a focus on how sentiment affects language choices).

<h4>TEACHING</h4>

<p>
  In semester 1, 2022, I'll be teaching

  <ul>
    <li>
      COMP2010 Algorithms and Data Structures
      [<a href="https://coursehandbook.mq.edu.au/2022/units/COMP2010/">Handbook</a>
      | <a href="https://unitguides.mq.edu.au/unit_offerings/149765/unit_guide">Unit Guide</a>]
</li>
<li>
      COMP7220 Data Science and Machine Learning 
      [<a href="https://coursehandbook.mq.edu.au/2022/units/COMP7220/">Handbook</a>
      | <a href="https://unitguides.mq.edu.au/unit_offerings/150804/unit_guide">Unit Guide</a>] 
</li>
<li>
      COMP8220 Machine Learning 
      [<a href="https://coursehandbook.mq.edu.au/2022/units/COMP8220/">Handbook</a>
      | <a href="https://unitguides.mq.edu.au/unit_offerings/150644/unit_guide">Unit Guide</a>] 
</li>
  </ul>

  In semester 2, 2022, I'm on long service leave.

</p>




<p>
I've taught a <a
href="./teaching/teaching.html#past_teaching">range of units</a>
    over the years.
I also think it's useful for students to know something about what their
teachers are likely to be like.  As one source of information, there's
the sporadic appearance of the Alternative Calendar, but computing
units are hardly ever mentioned there, and it usually sounds as if
there's only ever a couple of (disgruntled) respondants.

So, in case you're thinking of taking a class with me, here's a link
to 
<a 
href="./teaching/teaching.html#past_teaching_evals">evaluations for
several of my units</a>.
</p>



<h4>OTHER</h4>

<p>
Some <a href="other.html">non-work things</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'm a member of
Macquarie's <a href="https://staff.mq.edu.au/work/diversity-and-community/programs-and-initiatives/ally-network">Ally Network</a>.
